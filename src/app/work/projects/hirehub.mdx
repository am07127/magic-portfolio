## Overview

This project focuses on addressing biases in AI-driven resume screening systems. By leveraging LLMs, fairness-aware ranking models, and bias mitigation techniques, we ensure an equitable hiring process. The system is seamlessly integrated into a Next.js full-stack web application for real-world usability and testing.

## Key Features

- **Resume-to-Job Matching**: Uses transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) to rank resumes against job descriptions.
- **Bias Detection**: Implements fairness metrics like demographic parity and disparate impact to identify bias.
- **Debiasing Techniques**: Applies adversarial re-weighting and in-processing strategies for fair ranking.
- **Visualization & Reporting**: Generates reports showcasing pre- and post-debiasing fairness scores.
- **Next.js Integration**: Enables real-time analysis through a full-stack web interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For text embeddings and NLP tasks.
- **Fairlearn & Audit-AI**: To measure and mitigate bias.
- **scikit-learn**: For classification and ranking models.
- **Next.js & Tailwind CSS**: For frontend and backend integration.
- **FastAPI**: As the backend service handling resume processing and model inference.

## Challenges and Learnings

- Handling fairness trade-offs while maintaining ranking performance.
- Balancing real-time processing within a Next.js environment.
- Ensuring interpretability and transparency in model decisions.

## Outcome

The project successfully demonstrates a working prototype of a bias-aware resume ranking system. The integration with a Next.js web application allows for real-time usability and testing, providing HR professionals with an ethical AI-driven hiring tool.
